A group of enthusiastic marine scientists interested in human dimensions of marine fisheries, seafood supply chains, and ocean governance, we work under the direction of Dr. Joshua Stoll at The Univeristy of Maine. You can find out more about our lab at [Dr. Stoll's website.](www.joshua-stoll.)

This GitHub organization is where we collaborate behind the scenes, and host the data and code necessary to reproduce our published works. If you are interested in learning more about what we do or collaborating with us - do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting!
