Our group is engaged in interdisciplinary and applied research related to sustainable fisheries, marine and coastal governance, food systems, and social-ecological dynamics. We work on a range of projects that fit within three broad themes:

Coastal Community Adaptation and Resilience: Why and how are communities adapting to systemic changes? What strategies enable (disable) the equitable distribution of resources? What are the cumulative impacts of socioeconomic and environmental change on communities’ adaptive capacity?

Seafood Systems:  What happens to seafood when it enters the market (aka unpacking the black box)? What role does seafood trade and distribution play in fostering coastal community health and well-being? How can seafood distribution foster resilience and strengthen local and regional food systems? Learn more about our applied work [here](http://www.localcatch.org). 

Ocean and Coastal Governance: How does governance shape coastal communities’ access to and engagement with marine resources? What forms of policy facilitate collaboration and empower local peoples?

Our research is often informed by real-world engagement with marine resource users, coastal community stakeholders, and policymakers. You can find out more about our lab [here](www.joshua-stoll).

Social Oceans Lab is where we use open science methods to collaborate, maintain code, and published our work. If you are interested in learning more about what we do or collaborating with us - do not hesitate to reach out.
